                Hello there. My name is Andrew Hassing (he/him).
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a software engineer from Omaha, NE. I have primarily worked in the backend realm. This is my first attempt at a personal React project.

                Not to brag, but I've always been interested in math and technology. I started making my own websites in 6th grade. (They were mostly about how to make custom characters on the Nintendo 64 WWF Warzone game. I emailed the hosting company in high school to have the sites deleted so no use in trying to find them <i className='smile outline icon'></i>). 
            </p>

                I went to college at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, graduating in 2009 with a degree in math and actuary science. I worked in the life insurance industry for a few years, but never found a passion for the field.

                I went back to school at the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 2015 for a degree in computer science, which I immediately liked much better. I graduated in 2017 with a BS, and continued on for a MS in 2019. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the career change, I have worked in energy, defense contracting, and e-commerce. I've found my passion, and enjoy learning new technologies and systems.
